# Tour-Guide-App
An Android Basics Nano degree course project from Udacity
### Project Description: 
**Create an app which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city.**
Create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category. 

**Tour Guide App** is a simple tour app that presents relevant information as to places to visit to a user who’s visiting Ghana for the first time.

**Hint:** If you encounter an installation error, Click Build tab ---> Clean Project ---> Run it again :)
